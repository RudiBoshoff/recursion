PROJECT: RECURSION https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion#warmup-fibonacci

Assignment: 1  

1. Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).  

PROJECT: MERGE SORT https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion#project-merge-sort  

Assignment 2:  

1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
2. Tips:
* Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
* It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.
